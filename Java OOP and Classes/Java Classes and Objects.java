// Java Classes/Objects
// Java is an object-oriented programming language.

// Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

// A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

// Create a Class
// To create a class, use the keyword class:

// MyClass.java
// Create a class named "MyClass" with a variable x:

// public class MyClass {
//   int x = 5;
// }
// Remember from the Java Syntax chapter that a class should always start with an uppercase first letter, and that the name of the java file should match the class name.

// Create an Object
// In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named MyClass, so now we can use this to create objects.

// To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:

// Example
// Create an object called "myObj" and print the value of x:

// public class MyClass {
//   int x = 5;

//   public static void main(String[] args) {
//     MyClass myObj = new MyClass();
//     System.out.println(myObj.x);
//   }
// }
