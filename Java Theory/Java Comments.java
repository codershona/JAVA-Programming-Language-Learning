// Java Comments
// Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

// Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).

// Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

// This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

// Example
// // This is a comment
// System.out.println("Hello World");

public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // This is a comment
      System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
  }
